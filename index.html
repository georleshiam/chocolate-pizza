      For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown
      sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of the figs and toss in the saucepan
      with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently,
      until you have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set
      aside and let cool completely. Ice cream: In a small pot over medium heat,
      combine milk, and granulated sugar until sugar is completely dissolved and
      the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in
      the fridge and wait until the fig mixture is cooled. Using an ice cream
      machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process according to
      manufacturer instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes
      before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and the nuts. Continue to
      process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or
      glass tupperware. Freeze for at least two hours before serving.
